## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

This document uses the Quarto [visual markdown editor](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/). Use the button at the far right of the editor toolbar to switch between visual and source code mode.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded code within the document. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

Use the **Insert** menu to create additional code chunks and to add links, images, equations, and more to your document.

## Plot Output

You can also include plots, for example:

```{r}
#| echo: false
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo: false` option is added (within a special comment) to prevent printing of the code that generated the plot.
