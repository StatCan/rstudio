## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished presentation. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

This presentation uses the Quarto [visual markdown editor](https://quarto.org/docs/visual-editor/). Use the button at the far right of the editor toolbar to switch between visual and source code mode.

## Slide with Bullets

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes:

-   Content authored with markdown
-   Output from executable code

By default source code is not displayed in presentation output. Use the `echo: true` option to change this behavior

## Slide with Code

You can embed code like this (note that we use `echo: true` to show the code as well):

```{r}
#| echo: true
1 + 1
```

Use the **Insert** menu to create additional code chunks and to add links, images, equations, and more to your document.

## Slide with Plot

```{r}
plot(pressure)
```
